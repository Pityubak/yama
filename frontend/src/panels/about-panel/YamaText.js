                In the middle of previous century Captain Broomhead was a brave man from Earth, who disvovered our home, Pixie7.
                And on this planet found some of wonderful and akward creature. One of them people started to call "Yama".
                Yama is a hybrid species, man and mushrooms, some people call they "manshroom". Very famous visionary
                Giorgio A. Tsoukalos predicted existence of Yama, but the silly people did not believe it.
                In present day Yama have same right like other humanoids, just the smelly earthlings use they like pet.
                Here is no judgement, if you would a pet, fine steak or lover, you can purchase cheap and easily your own Yama!
